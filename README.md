Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

Mercedes-Benz car comes in the name of the world's top car list, Mercedes-Benz's car specaility is its performance, safety and comfort. Daimler is a giant company in Europe.

Mercedes-Benz manufacturing rate is high because of the its greate system and advance technology, Daimler cars testing system is a highly efficient system, so testing cars is more time consuming but it is a very important aspect.

When the testing time of the car increases the emission of carbon will increase, to reduce carbon dioxide emission to keep Daimler's testing quality standard, and need a good method for reducing the testing time.

Testing system is very complex and has a number of possible features, its time-consuming process, that's we need machine learning algorithm to reduce the testing time. Dataset contains different features like binary features, categorical features with testing time of cars(label) feature.

The present work concludes data pre-processing as there some outlier in the data, will remove it using machine learning different approaches, identify the important feature to reduce the dimensionality reduction with different methods and will do some feature engineering and create the new features, to predicting the high score and reduce the testing time. 

We will use the coefficient of determination aka R-squared metric. Finally, different regression and powerful ensemble methods chosen for the predict testing time in unseen data
